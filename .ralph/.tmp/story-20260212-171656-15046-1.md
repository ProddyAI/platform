### S1: Unify assistant orchestration behavior
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
Standardize runtime behavior between Convex assistant flow and Next.js chatbot route so prompts, tool selection behavior, and response envelope are consistent and predictable.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Assistant responses include a consistent metadata shape across both execution paths
- [ ] Behavior for external-tool and internal-tool queries is documented and deterministic
- [ ] No regression in conversation creation, message persistence, or streaming
