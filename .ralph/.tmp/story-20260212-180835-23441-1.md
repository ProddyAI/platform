### S4: Harden error handling and fallback UX
Status: in_progress
Depends on: S1

Description:
Normalize error handling across assistant and composio routes so failures produce actionable messages and preserve usable fallback responses.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Composio path failures return actionable user-facing messages
- [ ] Fallback assistant response is returned for recoverable failures
- [ ] Error logging is consistent and does not leak sensitive data
